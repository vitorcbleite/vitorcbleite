- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitorcbleite
- 👀 I’m interested in clean energy and nanomachines cause I humbly think they are the future of mankind. Since they are too far apart I'm returning as Java developer with around 6 years of hands-on experience on end-to-end positions. During my time working with java (since 2012) I've had the opportunity to work with many different technologies and frameworks and also could really see Java grow and become an even smarter language, like adhering to lambda expressions, as such I would be able to bring a vast set of expertises and provide maintanance on both modern and legacy systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently working Java 21+ and SpringBoot on modern front frameworks like Angular, React, Node, etc, with varied Databases on agile environment and cloud mainly aws but I'm trying to use the rest as well personally. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Applications using both front and back end java APIs to grow up.
